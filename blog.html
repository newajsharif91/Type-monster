          <h4>1. Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage..</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 text-secondary">
            <span class="fw-semibold">Ans: </span><br>
            <strong>Local Storage:</strong><br>
            This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions.<br>
             Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).<br>
             <strong>Session Storage:</strong><br>
             Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property.<br>
             The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. <br>
             Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage objects.

          <h4 class="mt-5">2. Difference between global scope and block scope.</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 text-secondary"><span class="fw-semibold">Ans: </span><br>
            <strong>Global Scope:</strong><br>
            The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.<br>
            <strong>Block Scope :</strong> <br>
            Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

          <h4 class="mt-5">3. How Even Loop works in JavaScript?
            or, Event Loop in JavaScript: How JavaScript Works Under the Hood.</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 text-secondary">
            <span class="fw-semibold">Ans:</span> <br>
            JavaScript is a single-threaded language. In other words, it can do only one thing at a time. JavaScript executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, gives us the illusion of multi-threading. The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming.
JavaScript engine executes a script from the top and works its way down creating execution contexts and pushing and popping functions onto and off the call stack.

          <h4 class="mt-5">4. How can we get undefined ?</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 text-secondary">
            <span class="fw-semibold">Ans:</span> <br>
            undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.
<ol>
  <li>In all non-legacy browsers,</li>
<li> undefined is a non-configurable,</li>
<li>non-writable property.</li>
<p>(Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.)</p>
</ol>
